OmniBrain is a multi-agent AI system that understands financial documents containing text, tables, and charts. A LangGraph supervisor breaks complex queries into smaller tasks, assigns them to specialized agents, retrieves relevant information from multiple data sources, and combines the results into one accurate, cited answer.

**Example use case:** feed in a multi-page financial report PDF, then ask a question like *"What was the Q3 revenue growth in Asia Pacific, and does it match the chart in the presentation?"* — OmniBrain retrieves the relevant text, reads the actual chart image, cross-references structured data, and returns one answer with `[Source, Page]` citations for every claim.

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React + Vite, Tailwind, `motion/react` — served as static build via FastAPI |
| API Gateway | FastAPI (`/upload`, `/query`) |
| Orchestration | LangGraph (state machine, conditional routing, citation-grounded synthesis) |
| Vector Store | FAISS (local, in-memory) |
| Relational Store | SQLite |
| LLM / VLM | OpenAI GPT-4o (text reasoning, Text-to-SQL, vision) |
| PDF Ingestion | PyMuPDF (`fitz`) — text extraction + full-page rendering |

## Key Design Decisions

This project deliberately favors a **lean, dependency-minimal stack** over a "textbook enterprise" setup, on the principle that the value being demonstrated is the *agentic reasoning pipeline*, not infrastructure operations. Where the original design called for heavier tooling, a lighter substitute was used instead:

| Originally considered | Used instead | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Qdrant (vector DB) | FAISS (in-memory) | No server to run/maintain for a single-user local system |
| PostgreSQL | SQLite | Zero setup, file-based, sufficient for structured demo data |
| Camelot / Tesseract (table & OCR extraction) | Full-page rendering to the Vision Agent | Vector-drawn charts and complex tables are notoriously brittle to parse structurally; rendering the whole page and letting GPT-4o read it visually is more robust and avoids a whole class of fragile dependencies |
| NeMo Guardrails + Langfuse | A custom citation-enforcement check in the Supervisor's synthesis step | Full observability/guardrails tooling was out of scope for an MVP; a lightweight rule — every factual claim must carry a `[Source, Page]` citation, or the response is rejected — captures the core hallucination-prevention goal directly |

These substitutions are documented in detail, along with the full build history, in [`docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md`](docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md) and [`QA_REPORT.md`](QA_REPORT.md).

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ (for the frontend build)
- An OpenAI API key with available quota

### 1. Clone and configure environment

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd OmniBrain
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY — never commit this file
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python backend/init_db.py        # Initializes SQLite schema + progress ledger
```

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build                    # Produces frontend/dist, served by FastAPI
cd ..
```

### 4. Run

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."   # Windows: $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
uvicorn backend.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` — FastAPI serves both the API and the built React frontend on a single port.

### 5. Try it out
1. Upload a PDF via the Ingestion panel (or use `tests/generate_test_pdf.py` to create a sample).
2. Ask a question in the Query panel that spans multiple data types, e.g. *"What was the revenue growth shown in the chart, and how does it compare to the database figures?"*
3. The response includes `[Source: filename, Page: N]` citations for every factual claim.

## CI/CD Pipeline

OmniBrain uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`):
- **CI (Test)**: Runs on every push and pull request to the `main` branch. It sets up the environment, builds the React frontend, initializes the SQLite database, and runs the Playwright End-to-End tests (which mock the OpenAI API to run offline).
- **CD (Deploy)**: If the CI tests pass on a push to `main`, the CD job automatically deploys the latest version to Google Cloud Run using keyless authentication (Workload Identity Federation).

## Testing

```bash
python tests/test_e2e.py
```

This runs Playwright-driven UI tests (rendering, error states) plus a backend functional test verifying multi-agent state accumulation and citation enforcement. See [`QA_REPORT.md`](QA_REPORT.md) for exactly what is and isn't covered — notably, full end-to-end verification with a live (non-mocked) GPT-4o call is currently pending available OpenAI quota.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Local storage only.** SQLite and FAISS live on local disk — this is intentional for a single-user demo, but means state does not persist across container restarts if deployed, and does not scale across multiple instances without migrating to managed storage (Cloud SQL, a hosted vector DB).
- **No rate limiting.** The `/query` and `/upload` endpoints have no throttling; exposing this publicly without additional middleware risks unexpected OpenAI usage costs.
- **Deployment is deferred.** A `Dockerfile` and deploy script exist and were validated for structure, but Cloud Run deployment itself is currently out of scope by design — see `QA_REPORT.md`.

## Roadmap / Next Steps

- Verify real (non-mocked) GPT-4o reasoning quality once OpenAI quota is available.
- Migrate to managed storage (Cloud SQL + a hosted vector DB) if moving beyond single-instance local use.
- Add basic rate limiting before any public deployment.
- Extend the Progress Ledger pattern to Projects 2 and 3 of this portfolio series.
